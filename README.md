# Toontown Rewritten Bot

This is a script written using AutoHotKey that automates certain tasks within Toontown Rewritten.

It is able to efficiently train doodles by using pixel color scanning to determine when the doodle is available for training. 
It then uses simulated mouse clicks to click the appropriate SpeedChat phrase for doodle training. 

This bot works for all resolutions and has a background mode for when game window is not in the foreground. 

## Usage & Installation
